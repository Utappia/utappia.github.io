Bundles are a great way to backup entire Git repositories. They also let you share changes without a network connection. Materials and Methods We will use the git bundle utility inside our local repository and also git merge to deploy our bundled repo. git bundle turns a repository into a single file that retains the versioning information of the entire project. Here are a list of options that are available: 'git bundle' create <name-of-the-bundle> <git-rev-list-args> 'git bundle' verify <file> 'git bundle' unbundle <file> [<refname>...] Create a bundle While you are inside a repo run: git bundle create ../myrepo.bundle master` It should print out something like this: Counting objects: 43, done. Delta compression using up to 2 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (39/39), done. Writing objects: 100% (43/43), 54.44 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done. Total 43 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0) This will create the bundle outside (one folder above) the repo and name it myrepo.bundle . When we created the file It was like we where just pushing our master branch to a remote, except it's contained in a file instead of a remote repository. Verify the bundle Before we move our bundle its a good idea to verify its content and check that the bundle file is valid and relevant to the current repository. While you are inside a repo run: git bundle verify ../myrepo.bundle` It should print out something like this: The bundle contains this ref: 230b04bdd3367b2db73 refs/heads/master The bundle records a complete history. ../myrepo.bundle is okay Deploy the bundle Assuming that you have the myrepo.bundle file in /home/user and you have created a folder newrepo and initialized a git repository inside it. Here is a generic procedure: mkdir newrepo cd newrepo git init git bundle unbundle ../myrepo.bundle the last command will inform you with the HEAD of you repo f7243ba54eb7de4b76a0 HEAD Now you can merge the contents of myrepo.bubdle file with the one that you initialized inside the newrepo folder: git merge f7243b Alternative procedures are also available, so please follow the links provided on the References section Results and discussion As you can see once you create the bundle file you can easily move it to another folder on the same or an other machine. Assume you want to transfer the history from a repository R1 on machine A to another repository R2 on machine B. For whatever reason, direct connection between A and B is not allowed, but we can move data from A to B via some mechanism (USB flash drive, email, etc..). This way we can update R2 with development made on the branch master in R1.

Gedit: Simple to use text editor Remastersys: You have installed some applications and you want to share the resulted OS with your friends or you want a complete backup ? This the app for the job. Apart from the above there are no other unnecessary software, so you can install what ever you want. What else : The iQunix 12.04 will be supported with software and system updates for 5 years . This means that you install once and have it for 5 years. Also the ISO files that is available for download, will be updated with the latest updates, so that if some time later on the lifecycle of iQunix 12.04, you need to re-install, you will have an up-to-date ISO.

Many users contacted me reporting a weird \"Network Connection\" problem when they installed the latest Optimus Kernel. Wile I was testing to see if this is just a \"Optimus Kernel\" issue, I saw that in the latest version of Ubuntu 12.04 Beta this is not an issue. I am not 100% certain what had caused this but I have found the one to blame: AppArmor It seems that the version of AppArmor that is present in Ubuntu 11.10, doesn't let DHCP to establish a network connection. So in the meantime I have a permanet workaround. This will put DHCP daemon in a complain mode so that it will not be enforced by AppArmor to not make connection and so DHCP will just be let alone. Here is what you can do only once: First install apparmor utilities from Software Center or from terminal: sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils Then in your terminal login as a root! (this is necessary as plain \"sudo\" will not work) sudo -i Then you need to add DHCP in complain mode: aa-complain /sbin/dhclient Now that you have added DHCP in complaint mode, it should be listed in complaint mode apps: apparmor_status Now you should be able to establish network connection. I hope that I have resolved the issue for all optimus kernel users and I would be glad to hear back from you if you have any other problems.","tags":"Utappia Projects","loc":"http://utappia.org/no-network-connection-a-weird-problem.html","title":"No network connection, a weird problem..."},{"text":"iQunix 10.10v1 was released on 2011-03-15 end according to the release schedule of Ubuntu, it has come to an end-of-support.

There is a respectful amount of software out there that do things in the most easy way. But what happens when you want to use terminal and you just want to do things in a much easier way and not getting tired of typing? In computing, alias is a command in various command line interpreters (shells) such as Unix shells, 4DOS/4NT and Windows PowerShell, which enables a replacement of a word by another string. This way a long line of command can be replaced by simple human-understandable words. The file that incorporates all the aliases can be found either in home users folder .bashrc or .bash_aliases or in a system wide used folder /etc/bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc The general synax of adding aliases is by adding lines in the following manner: alias NICKNAME='full command here' Where the NICKNAME is a word/name that you will remember and invoke the 'full command here' part of the aliases. So for system maintenance purposes we will add some useful aliases. Open a terminal window and type : gedit .bashrc This will open the Gedit Editor so that we can add the following lines at the end of the file alias Update='sudo apt-get update' alias Upgrade='sudo apt-get upgrade' alias Install='sudo apt-get install' alias Clean='sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get clean' alias Editaliases='gedit ~/.bashrc' Save and close the terminal. You may need to logout and login back or type bash and hit enter to make the changes take effect. This way you can just type: Install vlc to install the vlc software. Some notes for the above aliases: The first letter of the NICKNAME is by purpose in capital letter so that we avoid to use some system reserved alias that we may not aware of. The aliases are distribution agnostic. Just change the debian commands with the one that resembles your distributions commands You can add as many aliases as you can remember to make your life easier in the command line world. A quick last tip: If you want to install a software that comes with a bunch of packages (.deb) you can add the following alias to avoid typing all the names of the packages: alias Multinstall='sudo dpkg -i *.deb' For example you have download Optimus Kernel and you see that it comes with multiple \".deb\" files. What you need to do is delete any package that you don't need from the folder and then type: Multinstall","tags":"Maintenance","loc":"http://utappia.org/must-have-aliases-for-system-maintenance.html","title":"Must have aliases for system maintenance"},{"text":"You can download the latest version of Optimus Kernel which is based on the following recipes : Linux 3.2.12 Ubuntu/Debian patchsets BFS and BFQ patches In-house optimizations Go Grab your Packages from the Download Page - - - > Optimus Change log : Rebuild and synced with 3.2.12 vanilla Linux kernel (for what is included please read the kernel log on website) Packages are named after \"linux-*-X.X.X-999-optimus\" to make sure that it is always the first kernel on the GRUB menu even if Ubuntu (or) derivatives have upgraded their kernel Kernel Change log : hwmon: (zl6100) Enable interval between chip accesses... target: Fix compatible reservation handling (CRH=1... iscsi-target: Fix reservation conflict -EBUSY response... i2c-algo-bit: Fix spurious SCL timeouts under heavy... rapidio/tsi721: fix bug in register offset definitions hwmon: (w83627ehf) Fix temp2 source for W83627UHG hwmon: (w83627ehf) Fix memory leak in probe function Ghwmon: (w83627ehf) Fix writing into fan_stop_time for... sparc32: Add -Av8 to assembler command line.

Any user who has ever used Ubuntu or any Debian derivative knows that the best way to have their system in a good shape and secure, must use the Update Manger to regularly check for any system and software updates. But that's one part of the procedure where most users usually stop. What about the packages that where downloaded for update reasons and now they are not needed and they reserve free space ? What about packages that where installed to satisfy dependencies for some packages and that are no more needed ? What about packages and configuration files which are not required by any other package upon your system ? What about the stored archives in your cache for packages that are no longer in the repositories or that have a newer version in the repositories ? Well, unfortunately the Update Manger doesn't deal with the above problems and do not provide any means to resolve them. Please read for more information at Comparison of uCareSystem and Update Manager>>> On the other hand, Linux and open source community in general, has created some wonderful tools and so we didn't have to reinvent the wheel.

Upon 10 years of experience on Linux distributions some of the hottest issues that I came across are: Does compiling from source provide real and sensible performance boosts for overall the operating system ? Does compiling and removing unnecessary options from Linux Kernel provide real system boost ? Well for sure, Gentoo Linux users will give a definite answer : YES! There is not one scientific answer to this question. But for the following question: Does changing the Kernel Scheduler provide real and sensible performance boosts for overall the operating system ? We give the answer: YES !

You just need to double-click the \" CaptureMe \" file and press \" Run \" Then you will be asked if you would like to record the video \" withsound \" or with \" no sound \". If you choose with sound, your microphone will be reserved as a sound recording device. After you make your selection and press \"OK\", your \"mouse point\" will be turned into a cross shape. If you click on your Desktop, your recording will be from your entire screen. If you click on a window then the recording will be just from that window. After you click on your Desktop ( full screen recording mode ), or on a window ( partial window recording mode ) you will be presented with a \"recording termination window\". You can minimize this windows until you feel that you want to finish the screencasting. After you have finished your recording just click on the minimized window of CaptureMe. On the unminimized window of CaptureMe, just click \"OK\" to stop the recording. Then you will be presented with the final window of completion which informs you that your recording has been saved in your HOME folder Now open your HOME folder and you will find the recorded video with a name like \"CaptureMe_DATE_TIME.avi\" Now you can use your favorite video editing application to edit the video and remove any parts you don't like !","tags":"Utappia Projects","loc":"http://utappia.org/screenshot-of-captureme-caught-in-action.html","title":"Screenshot of CaptureMe caught in action"},{"text":"I am exited for a brand new release of CaptureMe . This new release does not have some totally new features but a major BUG fix. CaptureMe was initially available as: terminal only application No Graphical user interface only in Greek language After some thoughts that I had (the story will be told soon...) I decided that for making it useful I had to deal with these \"bugs\". So after release v2.0 , CaptureMe had a major upgrade with the introduction of a simple user interface and no need for terminal use. But anybody who downloaded version 2.2 hit on a major BUG: No Recording of video with sound or NOT ! This was due to a translation typo which, did not produced any error or failure message and it just did not started recording even if it seemed to be recording :) So I am realy sorry for any inconvenience!

But uCareSystem continues its work where classic Update Manger stops. You may ask : what the heck does it do and why to use uCareSystem when there is already Ubuntu Update manager available Ubuntu's Update Manger will just inform you that there are available system update that can be installed. Most of the times users tend to ignore it thinking that its not necessary yet to install them or they are in the middle of something else and they Close the window that appears. Wrong move people! Lets compare uCareSystem with Ubuntu Update manager with a simple user case: Lets say, you hate command line and you want to maintenance your system by keeping all parts with the latest updates. You open \"Update Manager\" You press \"Check\"\" to refresh your package list If there are updates available you press \"Install updates\" Then it asks you \"Confirm to install the updates\" Then you press \"Yes\" Update manager installs the updates and after it finishes, you press \"Close\" to close it. As a good \"admin\" of your system you want to cleanup the packages that left behind this procedure You use Synaptics, or UbuntuTweak , or Gtkorphan to clean the files under \"var/cache/apt/archives\", remove orphaned packages and clean up old residential config files. After many that many \"next.. next… OK… click… click… done\" your system is up-to-date and cleaned up. How about doing all of the above in just ONE application which will act as a \"Wizard\" and give you all the \"moves\" in one place.

Not many people are willing to compile a linux kernel from source but would definitely install a prepackaged one if they were given the opportunity. So... I have some good news for anyone interested. As you may know I keep posting any news about stable releases of Linux Kernel and updates about Zen Kernel. Well today, I created a github repository to upload prebuilt packages of the latest BFS optimized Linux kernel so that anyone can download and install these packages. System Requirements : - OS: Ubuntu - CPU: Intel or AMD - Arch: 32bit and 64bit This repo will always have the latest stable release packages of BFS optimized Linux Kernel so stay tuned... To use them just install the 3 packages related to your Operating Systems architecture: Ubuntu 32bit : linux-headers- all.deb , linux-headers- .deb, linux-image-*i386.deb Ubuntu 64bit: linux-headers- all.deb , linux-headers- amd64.deb, linux-image-*amd64.deb You can keep up with the latest news about brand new package releases by reading : Utappia or the social network pages Update (13-Mar-2012) : Now compatible with Intel and AMD cpu's on Ubuntu 64bit. Stay tuned for 32bit packages Update (15-Mar-2012) : Because now I don't use Zen Kernel but I build my own BFS/BFQ patched Ubuntu kernels, I removed the Zen Deb repo and created a new one \"Optimus Linux Kernel\" Update (15-Mar-2012) : Added 32bit packages to the downloaded ziped archive","tags":"Utappia Projects","loc":"http://utappia.org/bfs-bfq-optimized-linux-kernel-packages-ready-for-install.html","title":"BFS – BFQ optimized linux kernel packages ready for install"},{"text":"For some time now, I have stopped using the Linux kernel that comes bundled with the Ubuntu operating system and use a version that has a different approach on the matter of kernel schedulers . \"Scheduler\" is a time-resource-manager (task scheduler) who determines which process and how much it employs the processor (CPU) of the computer. The official scheduler of the Linux kernel is the CFS. In the past, I made several experiments (benchmarks) to see if I could find any noticeable difference in performance of my system by optimizing the kernel and changing the scheduler. The results of the experiments did not give me any reasonable grounds for the necessity of optimizing the Linux Kernel, let alone to change the scheduler of the kernel on modern machines. Nevertheless I continued to use a Linux Kernel with the BFS scheduler (see my article here : [Greek] Optimizing Ubuntu Linux Kernel with BFS - BFQ ) and of course to optimize the kernel according the specs of my machine. But yesterday, something really unexpected happened and I saw before my eyes the huge difference in performance that can give a Linux Kernel scheduler not only to an old PC but also to a modern PC with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a Intel i7 Quad Core CPU !! Preface: Completely Fair Schedule (CFS): To quote Wikipedia \"The Completely Fair Scheduler is the name of a task scheduler which was merged into the 2.6.23 release of the Linux kernel . It handles CPU resource allocation for executing processes, and aims to maximize overall CPU utilization while also maximizing interactive performance.\" CFS is the standard scheduler for Android. As such it is compatible with all apps and processes run in Android Brain FUCK Scheduler (BFS): To quote Mr. Con Kolivas , the developer of BFS \"BFS is the Brain Fuck Scheduler . It was designed to be forward looking only, make the most of lower spec machines, and not scale to massive hardware. ie it is a desktop orientated scheduler, with extremely low latencies for excellent interactivity by design rather than \"calculated\", with rigid fairness, nice priority distribution and extreme scalability within normal load levels.\" Google looked at BFS to use as the Android scheduler but decided that it wasn't mature enough yet. Experiment: In this experiment I used a 1,6 GB video file (.MOV) 40 minutes long and started to render it on 720p resolution. The system had the same Uptime and same conditions. The screenshot was taken on the same percentage so that we can have a fair measurement on \"estimated completion time\". I repeated this experiment for about 10 times, keeping the same conditions and it gave me the same results. Now this is what I got : As you can see with the BFS scheduler the \"Job\" will be completed in half of the time that CFS needs. One observation that can not be seen in a picture is that with BFS the CPU had a constant and steady 98-100% CPU utilization, in contrast with CFS the CPU utilization was dropping from time to time to 25%.

The distribution is called iQunix and it is an Ubuntu based distribution. It is pronounced as i-qu-nix ( iqunix pronounce ), and the focuses (or at least it tries to) on the respect that a simple *nix oriented operating system that should have on the intelligence (iq) of the end-user :) Introduction Most Linux distributions come along with pre-installed applications, beautiful graphics, docks, gorgeous icons, that in most cases you will inevitably change or modify them. For instance, when someone completes the installation of Ubuntu, the system has already applications pre-installed usually OpenOffice , Firefox, Evolution, MeMenu, Gwiber, Transmission and some other apps that the end-user may not even be aware of. The average user will ignore them and use his preferred applications like Chrome instead of Firefox, VLC instead of Totem Movie Pl, Twitter and Facebook instead of Gwiber and so on. Also the more experienced users will try to uninstall, all the applications that are in no use for them. In contrast iQunix OS is just the Operating System with a clean Gnome desktop environment . There is just the minimum software stack that is required to make a functional desktop environment and actually nothing is pre-installed. This way iQunix lets the user decide how should his desktop look like and what applications he needs, respecting his intelligence. What's included Gedit -- Simple text editor Terminal -- For those who know the power of linux shell (2Click Update) now callded uCareSystem. A simple, yet intuitive system maintenance app Nautilus -- The best file manager to manage your files and folders Remastersys To make a backup of your entire operating system with all your installed programs Hardware Drivers installer. To automatically detect you systems graphic card and wireless network card and install the appropriate drivers Synaptic Package Manager. To install the programs of your choice. Users of iQunix can immediately start using Synaptic Package manager to install additional software, add his favorite icons, themes and wallpapers from Gnome Eyecandies , or from where ever he wants. Advantages - Disadvantages Let's see what are the advantages and disadvantages if you decide to use iQunix OS Benefits Speed – It is just the operating system without any preinstalled applications. Ubuntu by nature -- with all the available apps that are used by millions of users. Support from the community of Ubuntu -- A Google search on any topic combined with the word \"Ubuntu\" will return millions of results, user tips, articles and how-to's. It is lightweight without unnecessary system services running in the background Disadvantages Adjustment Time, a necessary period of time is needed to adjust the system based on user needs. It gives the same user experience offered by Windows, in which the OS is \"empty\" of applications and users must install the applications such as Office, Browser, Video Player, Music Player etc. Core system environment the power of choice and freedom is where the end user decides what he wants to install and not. It is a bit \"ugly\" the end user decides according to his aesthetic criteria of how beautiful should the desktop environment look like Target Group Average users If you have ever installed Ubuntu (at least once), added your favorite applications and you have used it every day, then iQunix is the ideal environment to build your unique desktop environment. Experienced users iQunix is also suitable for those who prefer to have control of their system, from the ground up and to decide what should and what should not be installed. Usually these users are those who want the power of Debian without sacrificing the \"amenities\" offered by Ubuntu. Professionals In work environments, professionals usually use a minimum sets of applications that are necessary for their work. iQunix is ideal for professionals because they get only the operating system on which they can install the applications that are necessary for their work. This way their \"workstation\" is not overloaded by unnecessary applications and thus making the system unstable. Researchers If you are a researcher and use for example only one application (e.g Matlab) for complex mathematical algorithms, iQunix is the ideal environment because it does not compromise your system resources with applications and background services that are not in use. Support Ubuntu project has been committed to a regular release cycle and has managed to deliver on that commitment without fail. As mentioned before, iQunix is based on Ubuntu, therefore it will follow the regular system maintenance updates provided by the Ubuntu community and Canonical. The current version of iQunix is based on Ubuntu 10.10 (it has all the system updates that have been released for Ubuntu since October 2010) and hence it will receive software maintenance updates until April 2012. Finally, in future and depending on the needs I will provide some Patches and Wizards that can be run by the end user. Epilogue As a Linux user you know what are your needs therefor, iQunix offers a clean environment with the known \"easy to use\" desktop of Ubuntu, to customize it according those needs. As your needs are personal and different from others, why should your OS not differ?","tags":"Utappia Projects","loc":"http://utappia.org/iqunix-os-clean-fast-and-simple-os.html","title":"iQunix OS: Clean, Fast and Simple OS"},{"text":"\"Everybody wants to do something to help, but nobody wants to be first.\" Donation We have put, time and effort to bring out the best of our self for this project.
